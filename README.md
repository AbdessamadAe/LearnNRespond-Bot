# LearnNRespond-Bot

Welcome to the LearnNRespond-Bot repository! This interactive chatbot is designed to engage in human-like conversations and improve its capabilities by learning from user inputs.

## Project Overview

LearnNRespond-Bot is a conversational agent that not only provides answers to questions based on its current knowledge base but also has the ability to expand its database by learning from the interactions with users. The more you chat with it, the smarter it becomes.

## Key Features

- **Learning on the Go**: Incorporates new knowledge through user interaction, expanding its database with every new piece of information provided.
- **Smart Matching**: Employs advanced string matching algorithms to find the best possible response to user queries.
- **Persistent Knowledge**: Utilizes a JSON file to maintain and update the knowledge base between sessions.
- **Interactive Experience**: Designed to simulate a friendly conversation with users and prompt them to contribute to its learning.

## Getting Started

To set up your own instance of LearnNRespond-Bot, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LearnNRespond-Bot.git

## How to Use

After starting the bot, engage with it by typing questions or phrases. If the bot does not have an answer, it will prompt you to provide one. You can type the answer or 'skip' to move on without adding to the knowledge base.
